# FAQ
[heading__faq]: #faq


> Okay, so that was a bit much!  So to save you a bit of time, here are answers
> to questions I get asked often during consultations/interviews.


## What type of employment relationship do you prefer?


It is often swifter, both for onboarding and administration/payroll, to be
classified as a contractor/free-lancer.  However, for truly interesting
projects I am may consider a "full-time"/"real employee" position.


## Why was the name "S0AndS0" chosen?


Quality of content and character are what matters.  So I've used it as a
pen-name (for decades now) to reduce opportunities for reader biases because
it is; race-less, genderless, and not associated to any region or religion.  


## What projects are you most proud of?


[ViewERC721][heading__viewerc721httpsetherscanioaddress0xc6b2675f484931ca7d3771881ef7bd28c51dd00acode_source_code],
because it eliminated all sorts of issues such as; vendor lock-in, cache
invalidation, and unnecessary front/back-end network traffic.

[3D Printing][heading__3d_printinghttpsgithubcoms0ands03d_printing_source_code_and_websitehttpss0ands0githubio3d_printing],
because I learned so much!  Not only about Python and API integration with
Blender, but also how to edit video and audio.

[SASS Build][heading__sass_buildhttpsgithubcomghautilitiessassbuild_source_code_and_marketplacehttpsgithubcommarketplaceactionssassbuild_cicd_integration],
because people have found it useful, last I checked over
[200](https://github.com/gha-utilities/sass-build/network/dependents)
projects depend on it, plus some have found it worthy of
[contributing](https://github.com/gha-utilities/sass-build/graphs/contributors)
to too!


## What are your compensation requirements?


Happy I am to negotiate numbers based on projected project scope.  Though
please be aware that salary must be appropriate to the value I bring and work
scope.


## How is this document maintained/created?


I author this document via MarkDown syntax, with a sprinkling of LaTeX, and
utilize the `pandoc` CLI tool to transpile content as a PDF. Feel free to reach
out for details and/or request source code!


## When are you available for a screening interview?


Please check my [Calendly](https://calendly.com/s0ands0/30min) link for an
opening, and if there is no overlap with your your local time-zone then feel
free to [email][] me to coordinate a custom consultation time.


## How soon can you start?


To ensure current clients I service are setup for success, I require a minimum
of three weeks.


## Do you do free work such as bug hunting, testing, or code review?


No, current company
[policy](https://www.digital-mercenaries.com/frequently-asked-questions.html#do-you-offer-free-services-such-as-bug-testing-or-code-reviews)
requires that we negotiate compensation amount(s), and timing(s), prior to
preforming any work.
